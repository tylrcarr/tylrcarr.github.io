# Politics.

What are they good for?

Well, a lot, actually.

And as much as I'd love to give you a long paragraph about how poltiics is important, I'm not THAT self-grandiose and I'm sure you're not as stupid as you seem for someone reading about some random asshole on the internet.

It causes **so** much division among everyone, yet we still love it. Very interesting that some people think their tribe is better than others, yet from someone else's perspective that tribe is the dumbest of them all.

I'm not immune to this, I can admit I do harp a little too much on how stupid Marxism is. 

Anyways, back on to the main point of this post. 

I'm a moderate. Conservative leaning, libertarian leaning, but not by much. Here's my political compass so it's easier to see what I'm talking about.

But politics nowadays has gotten so toxic. I mean, as far as I can tell it has. I AM only 19 years old. I've lived through Obama and Bush, and became politically aware late Obama. But it's toxic.

I feel as if I don't preface all of my reddit comments with "I'm not a Trump supporter, but..." I'll be accused of being a Nazi and posting on The_Donald and cast off like some piece of shit who wants to exterminate (((them))). 

But I still like talking about it. Why is it, an alien might as, I subject myself to immense emotional pain just to feel the pride of being right?

Well, it's probably that I am an asshole in some ways. But it's much more likely I care about society as a whole.

As much as "conservatives" (anyone right of Obama) might seem like they hate the poor, it's much likelier (doesn't even look like a word) that I just have a different rational.

And that rational sets me apart from a lot of people. I love logical thinking more than most people to the right of me. I hate emotional thinking almost as much as I love logical thinking. Almost so much to the point where I just don't want emotions in politics. 

Every time I see an emotional appeal, I almost make it a point NOT to support that position. 

I've thought about why I'm that way, and there are many explainations. However, the one that matters to you was my watching of YouTube videos when I was younger. 

I really enjoyed listening to YouTubers "destroy" feminists. That genre really appeal to me. As well as atheism. I've since moved past all of that, but it *did* leave a mark on me.

But let me discuss some of my favorite thinkers today. They're going to be much more conservative, and I almost fear I'm becoming more conservative than younger me would've wanted. 

Jordan Peterson. Great man. He helped me get my life together in a way. He wrote a great book (which I STILL haven't finished, shame on me) which showcased some principles I've applied to daily life that's made me a much more productive person. He's also taught me a lot about debate and how to appeal to the kind of person that deserves my respect. I adore the way he systematically tears apart illogical ideas and shows the fault in their ways. I can't get enough of him.

Steven Crowder. Very funny guy, who has the brains to back it up. I've grown to appreciate the right-wing late night show he's put out. I'm not a donor (mostly because I don't watch him nearly enough to consider it), but I do watch every video he puts out. He's shown me a lot of the great minds I appreciate today.

Lastly, but certainly not least, Lauren Southern. I always heard she was a racist, islamophobe extreme right winger, but nothing could be further from the truth. She's shown me a lot of the logic behind these "islamophobic" ideas. And as much as I don't want to admit it, I was probably pulled in by her appearance. Very attractive woman who's made even more attractive my the intellegence she routinely displays.

But in the end, I call myself a moderate because I'm a moderate. We're a dying breed in America today, and hopefully I can eventually do something about that. 

Anyways, until next time,
