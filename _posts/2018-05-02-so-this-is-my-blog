# I've created a blog. 

I hope to use it every day. Maybe treat it like a diary, but instead telling everything about myself to all of my recruiters (that's you, potential recruiter)

Here's to my first post.

So I guess since I'm going to have to talk to everyone, I'll start off with a little about myself. I promise this isn't the internet version of alcoholics anonymous, or so I hope.

I'm Tyler Carr. I've been programming since I was 14 years old. You could call it a passion, because it is. I love it. I love the challenges. This isn't sucking up to potential employers (mostly), but this is the truth. 

I've done a lot of things in my short life. Some are cool, some aren't. 

I digress. Here's a few that make me myself: 

- I built a drone using a Raspberry PI, ESCS, motors, a cellular modem, a Pixhawk, tears, more tears, encouragement from my boss, and definitely some pre-heated blood (I have the dexterity of a dolphin, so soldering was very fun).

- I made that drone fly over cellular using Node.js and a Python script. I build this using a RESTful api that would send data. This is a lot more interesting than I make it sound, so if you want to talk about it just bring up "drones" in casual conversation and I'm sure I'll give you an earful if you also ask me about it. 

- I built a user system for my mother's webpage. I'll tell you something like "it's a weekend job" and I "got it from my mother's friends", but the truth is much less interesting. My mom wanted a webpage, so I made it. My mom later wanted a pretty webpage with users who can view certain things, and I sang slave hymns to the tone of my typing. 

- I work(adding an ed here for when I stop working there in the hopefully near future) at Bojangles where I serve the best biscuits in the LKN area (probably a lie) and add $8.50 an hour to the company (definitely a lie)

- I "teach" (teacher assistant is the better word here) a coding bootcamp at "UNC Charlotte" (Trilogy education, but a university sounds a lot cooler). If you ask me about this, I'll probably let out an earful because no one else asks more about it :(

- I went to Virginia Tech for a semester. Do not ask me about this, I'll deflect harder than a priest accused of being gay. But in all seriousness, I went here on the recommendation of my parents and I got decent grades and dropped out after learning I hate college.

But that's the gist of what's going on in my life right now. If you want to know more, I love talking to people, so feel free to shoot me a message somewhere. Just be sure to not be weird about it and I'll (probably) respond.

I think my next few blog posts will be personal. I love talking about myself because I try not to in real life. Nobody wants to hear about yourself but you, and if you're here I'm either really successful and you're trying to learn my ways or very unsuccessful and you're trying to learn how to not be me. It could also be out of pure interest, and I propose to you: how dare you care about my life?

Anyways, all has been said. Maybe I'll get home and write something cool. Maybe I won't. But until then, from your favorite and best candidate for any job I'm applying to,

Tyler Carr
