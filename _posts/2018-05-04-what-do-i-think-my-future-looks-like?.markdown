# My Future.

To be honest with you, I'm on day 2 and I'm alreadying racking my brain for what I should write about.

It's a light hearted day today. May 4th, 2018. I refuse to make May the Fourth jokes on principle. That principle is "if I'd have to resist the urge to bully someone for saying something, I will refuse to say it myself." That's only partially a joke.

But tomorrow is May 5th, and I'll be going to the second day of my Red Ventures program.

I'll also be doing other things, but I wouldn't want to hear about that if I were in your shoes to be honest.

So I was thinking about what I was going to be writing about today, and the first thing that popped up into my mind was my future.

And it made sense. I read or heard somewhere something about a future writing program. I remember it being too expensive to think about doing, so I just thought I'd do it on a later date.

However, that program isn't too complicated. You're supposed to write about the future that you want, and the future that you wouldn't want. 

I'm here today to write about the future I do want. 

## So here it actually begins. 

In my ideal future, I would've started a company. I don't know what this company would be, so let's assume for the sake of simplicity that it's a tech company. Let's call it a programming company, since that seems to be the most likely scenario. 

The reason I'd want to start a company was something I learned from my first true boss: you only get rich in one of a few ways, owning expensive property, owning expensive secrets, or owning a successful business. 

And my boss also taught don't trust 1 or 2 (he had a lot of property before the market crash), because you'll end up dead or wishing you were.

So I'd own a business. I want to think it'd be in a very beautiful area. It's always been my dream to live in Hawai'i, but I'm not entirely certain someone in the state of Hawai'i needs programming support. Let's call it California. It makes sense (minus the crazy taxes. But this is a dream, we don't have time to think about how I'm going to commit legal tax evasion in the state of California).

I'd own this programming business in California. I envision a place where everyone enjoys talking to each other. I envision a gym in the facility. I envision a place for pets.

And the business would be obviously successful, because what's a little more optimism gonna really do to me.

At this business I see myself managing others, while also helping program a little myself. And I see these people talking to me and being nice to me out of true enjoyment of myself and not because I'm their boss (although it would be a part of it). 

I imagine going home and seeing a big house on a hill overlooking the Pacific ocean. Now, this is where my vision probably diverges from most others.

I hear absolutely nothing. Nobody to talk to, just myself and a ton of square footage. Actually, I take that back: I want to see a very excited dog. A big one that doesn't shed. 

I want this dog to be an obedient one. Not one that'll jump up on you, but one that'll love you and lick you even still no matter who you are.

I visualize myself taking this dog on a walk. I'd probably live in a very nice neighborhood, so I have enough human contact to stay sane and keep my social skills, but not too much to where I feel obligated to talk to someone for the next hour. I walk this dog through the neighborhood, show him the sights, and bring him home. 

I would then go home, cook, and eat dinner. I'd get ready for bed through my nightly routine (which I currently severly lack), and I'd sleep happily next to my dog. 

The next morning, I'd wake up and prepare myself for another day. And I'd live that day to the fullest.

and **that** is what I see my future as. 

## A little analysis

It's very interesting I don't see my future with any wife or kids. I suspect it's because I don't really care for the stresses of a relationship. I know in my heart that I would eventually need one to stay sane, but I just don't see myself there. 

I'm glad I now have something to chase. I just have to figure out the steps to get to where I want to.

I expect my future to change in the near... uhh, future? But yeah, I do expect this to change.

Anyways, that'll be all for today.

With love,

Tyler Carr
