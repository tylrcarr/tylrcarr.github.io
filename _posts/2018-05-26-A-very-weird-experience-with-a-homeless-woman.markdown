# A very weird experience with a homeless woman.

Let me start off by saying I'm not a very religious person. I never have been. It's a mixture of actual doubts in myself and it being pushed way too hard on me when I was younger.

I also don't believe in weird godly coincidences. I've had multiple of what I thought at the time was a godly experience, and they really didn't change anything.

But something that happened today might change both of those things.

So, let me set the stage. 

It's Saturday, May 26th. Around 9:40amish. There's a slight smell of that post-rain ozone smell (which is apparently called petrichor, but I felt it was too pretentious to say that.) I went to my TA job at UNCC on a day where I wasn't supposed to (or at least wasn't required.) 

I parked kind of far from the university for free parking. Whatever, it was just a sketchy walk through a downtrodden street, I had thought. I'm a pretty big guy (6'1, 280ish), so I just assume no one would mess with me. 

I walked towards the building, listening to a new album by one of my favorite artists. The UNCC uptown area is actually really pretty except for this one road, but even still, I can't stop myself from exploring my surroundings with my eyes. I see cracked roads, spraypaint that was to indicate that there was maintainence to be done, the occasional trees, a parking lot with trash in it, and this weird tarp over some square. The tarp was obviously interesting, so I looked at it a little longer and I saw the back of a homeless person who I wasn't sure was a man or women. They had what I believed to be a light blue sports bra or a tennis shirt over a darker (maybe blue) shirt on, and I didn't check the pants but I think they were darker. 

In that area, I'd previously just heard people talking to themselves. I'd believe it's a pretty common place for the homeless to sleep for the tarp there.

Anyways, I had gone to class to find out the building was locked. I then remembered that we didn't have class, and I couldn't remember if it was the one day where were weren't supposed to come at all. So, I looked around, saw nobody that I knew or any cars in the lot, and I started walking back.

I walked through the little park next to UNCC, crossed the train tracks, and began walking down that road again.

Thinking about it now, it's kinda weird how the road is laid out. It's like two opposites on different sides of the track. 

On the UNCC Uptown side of the train tracks, the road was bricks. It was surrounded by greens. There were obvious signs and tracks to indicate where people might walk. There's reflectors to indicate where the middle of the road is, so they don't have to paint on the bricks.

On the other side, where my car was parked, there was a nearly abandoned parking lot with many modern tumbleweed (grocery bags) and random trash everywhere. There was the occasional broken down car, and a few people who I wouldn't be suprised to learn were homeless themselves walking through the lot. 

It's very weird, one side is this beautiful park, and the other is just... there. 

But anyways, I was walking down the street, and I was crossing the street (probably to avoid the homeless woman on the other side, because, as I said, I've previously heard too many people talking to themselves there and I don't want to hear something that'll get me killed.)

As I was midway, I noticed the woman was looking at me. I had my beats headphones on listening to that album. As I got closer, I saw she was looking at me, indicating she wanted to say something. 

I was taught street smarts, so I did a quick look around to check to see if this was some ploy to get me jumped. I'm not going to lie, I didn't look that much. I checked my left and right, but not my back. 

In the end, it didn't matter. That woman wasn't there to jump me.

So I took one headphone off. As I got closer, I began to see more small details on the woman.

She had no more than half of her teeth and no less than 25%. As she got closer, I subconciously began to hold my smells back. I don't exactly have the strongest stomach, so any bad smells can set me off. I saw the clothes she wore were dirtied. The woman was greasy, I learned as her black skin reflected in the morning sunlight. Her hair was obviously a mess, but it wasn't the mess that it would be if she were a white woman. It was just all bunched together and up. It was shorter, as I recall, so it didn't even reach her shoulders (whether that be because it was up or just too short.) The point is, she'd clearly been through some rough times.

The woman gave me her best 5 tooth smile, and I smiled back. I took off one headphone, and began to listen.

Through a voice that can be only described as not very unique, she began to talk to me. I had my one side of my headphones mostly on, so I stopped, and took off the second one about halfway. I thought about what she said for a second, and I got the point. It was essentially "how are you doing today?"

I said good, and my na√Øve mind told me to just take out my wallet and give her 10. As I was reaching for my wallet, she said something about god. In my cynical mind, I knew this was just a ploy to get me to donate money. I didn't care, honestly. She obviously needed the last $10 in my wallet more than I did. As I was pulling out the wallet, I said something to the effect of "Here, I don't really care". I meant I don't really care for the $10, but it probably came off as more of a "I don't really care about what you have to say" from my tone.

She stopped me in the middle, saying "No, I don't do this for money. I do this for love" in a very disarming way. I looked into her eyes and saw them smiling along with her mouth, which as I can now see had around 5 visible teeth all jagged every which way. So, I slowly began to slide my money back in my wallet and began the process of putting my wallet back in my pocket.

While I was doing that, she popped the question "Do you believe in god?" I had a very conditioned answer, as I had religion pushed on me a lot as a child, and I just said "Yes, I do."

The woman looked at me and didn't change her smile. At this point, I was fully stopped walking in the middle of the street on the destitute side. At this point, what she said was fuzzy because my mind was thinking "what does she want from me" and running all of the scenarios through my head. From what I gather, it was essentially just about love in general. What I do remember was 2 or 3 main points.

"I see a lot of potential in your face." she said. This really caught me off guard. At this point, I was at my lowest point in my life. I'd put in my two weeks notice on my lousy fast food job. I'd been told to not come back to the one program that I was going to put all of my faith into to get a job. My parents were starting to get on my back about having a future of only working 15 hours a week for the next month. I had the stresses of taking care of a alcohol charge and getting it transferred to NC from VA (which was recently somewhat relieved when I learned that I had another week to procrastinate this away.) I don't know how this woman saw potential in my face when everyone around me clearly just saw a lazy procrastinator. The cynical side of me is saying maybe it was because I was a lot different from the regular homeless men that she'd usually see, but from her face I could clearly tell the woman believed what she said and she wasn't trying to compliment me.

After she said that, I really started listening. Even though my body language might have been leaning slightly away from this woman, my face probably said a lot. It was a mixture of what I can only assume was confusion and introspection.

After around 1 or 2 seconds that felt like at least 10 seconds of thinking, she said "God loves you." and something to the effect of "he wants you." I thought a little more, but there wasn't really much to do but just take in what she was saying. I looked back into her eyes with confusion, and she told me "you have to go get it." Like she knew what to say to me. She had a slight bit of doubt in her eyes.

I don't think she was referring to the god sentence she said previously, but I could be wrong. This could very well be myself wanting to believe this was an act of god, because, honestly, I need an act of god to succeed on the path of life I've envisioned myself. 

I've been reading a lot of self motivational stuff, and what she'd said to me really spoke to me. I repeated in my head "you need to go get it." It made sense. I have to go get it. This is something that transcended my conversation with her. I really need to go get my life. Nobody is going to give it to me. Not god, not my parents, not my friends. I have to go get it.

I broke eye contact with this woman. She spoke to my soul, and the slight doubt in her eyes disappeared when she saw it clearly hit me. 

She gave me a look of knowing. She also gave me a few seconds to think about what she'd said. I looked her in the eyes, probably with a lot of confusion still, but with a lot more understanding and very meekly said to the woman "thank you."

The woman gave off body language that implied I was okay to leave. So I did. I turned around, looked at the woman with very thankful eyes that I believe said "I really needed this" and started walking. As I was just leaving I turned around and said "thank you for telling me this."

I don't remember the woman much more from this point, but from what I can gather she walked back to her tarp. I began walking back to my car, a trek of no longer than 30 more seconds. In those 30 seconds, I repeated "you have to go get it" and thought a lot about the information this woman just gave me. It felt like a long walk back. I looked around and the world just felt different. The homeless people on the other side of the street were no longer faceless, they were people with potential who didn't have the tools to maximize it. I don't want to waste my potential.

I repeated "I see a lot of potential in your face" in my head. It didn't sound crazy. The look the woman gave confirmed it. From what I gathered, the woman probably wasn't mentally coherent very often. But, in that moment, she had more clarity than what I'd see in anyone else. She was geniunely happy to talk to me. The cynical athiest somewhere in my would say "well, of course. She was mentally ill, of course she belived in god" but that just didn't ring. What's the point of trusting every negative thought towards a woman whose intent was clearly just to spread the love she might have never had? There was none. 

It was crazy, I said to myself. "What was crazy?" I felt my subconcious say to me. I thought a little more, looking at the ground. "If you say this to any of your friends, you'll have to explain how crazy this is." I was right. I would sound crazy if I told my friends about the profound effect two simple sentences you'll hear anywhere had on me coming from a homeless woman. But my subconcious told me "and so what? Why do you have to please those people?"

It was true. And that wasn't something I learned in that moment, but it was more true then than ever. I would obviously look crazy taking life advice from a woman who had clearly been homeless for a while.
 
And so what. At this point in my life, I need anything on my side I can take. I told myself I'd give a full red pill philosphy a try for a month, so why don't I give something that nearly all of my ancestors suceeded on a chance? 

I got back to my car. I got in. And I seriously thought about crying. I'm not much of a crier, but I think these words had a serious effect on me. I needed to hear this whether I liked it or not. I didn't cry, but I thought. And I thought. 

It was at this point I sent a slack message that said I went to class even though we weren't supposed to. Apparently, I was, but no one was there. So I got off at exit 16A and into some traffic. It took around 20 minutes, but I finally got the the light that brought me back to I77 south. 

I saw a homeless man with a sign, and I remembered my $10. I hesitated, but I thought of the woman. She wanted me to spread the love I had receieved. No matter how crazy that was, it was true. So I did. The man needed the 10 more than I did. "God bless you" I said to the man, and he gave the most confused look. Why would I steal his line? 

I said it once more, and drove off. I recognized a certain hole was filled in me. I didn't feel different, but the hole was filled without all of the stuff I usually used to fill it. 

And today, I start off on a new leaf. I hope that whatever happened today will change me, and I will let it.

With great love,

Tyler Carr
