# So why am I blogging?

I want to tell you I've been thinking about this for a while, but I really haven't. The truth is, I just decided I wanted to blog after I saw a 16 year old that goes to the programming school I did doing that.

Honestly.

But I do know why I would want to.

I love talking. Like any normal human, I love talking about myself in particular. I also enjoy politics, programming, basketball, and a few other things. But talking relates to all of those things.

I also don't have anyone to talk to. I work 7 days a week with around 16 total hours of true relaxation time per week. I just don't have the time to get close enough to someone where I'd trust them to know all of this.

So, logically, I'm telling everyone on the internet about myself. 

In all honesty, I'll be doing a mixture of "crowd pleasing" (i.e. nobody wants to hear about my day) and just letting it all out. Sometimes I want to talk about particular things that piss me off, make me feel good, helped me, or many other things, but I just have no one to talk to. I believe this will be what I will use to let it out.

I've heard everyone needs a creative outlet, so here will be mine. 

But in the end, I'm doing this for myself. If nobody reads this, I won't care. If everyone reads this, I'll probably care and likely shit my pants. But history points to the former. Nobody is interesting enough to have someone read every day of their life in cult fashion. I expect to be in the greater majority of bloggers, and I don't care to be honest. I just want to talk.

I had this talk with my subconcious. It went like this:

<span style="color:orange;">myself</span>
<span style="color:pink;">subconcious</span>
> <span style="color:orange;">what's up?</span>
> <span style="color:pink;">you should really start blogging</span>
> <span style="color:orange;">why's that?</span>
> <span style="color:pink;">I'll get to come out and the line of communication will be easier</span>
> <span style="color:orange;">I'll consider it</span>
> <span style="color:pink;">Cool</span>

So I did consider it. And I considered all of the aforementioned facts. I thought through it.

And here I am. Maybe one day internet historians will look back, see this blog, and think "hah get a load of this egotistical dumbass" and move on. Maybe one day this blog will be deleted with a minimal amount of posts on it. Maybe one day I'll do some Washington Post shit. 

But in the end, it won't matter. I'll have done this and see how it'll've gone (look at that triple contraction. You can call me Merriam-Webster pretty much.) And here's to hoping whatever happens with this is a resounding success.
