# Gratefulness

Something not many people have. 

I've been sick for the last two days, and I've had a lot of time to think. Obviously I was sick, so a lot of my thoughts were occupied with my sickness.

And I thought "man, I was never grateful for the times I WASN'T sick"

That provoked something in me. Gratefulness is a *very* rare trait. And those who have it don't have many worries.

It really puts stuff into perspective.

What does it matter that stuff is going wrong in my job, when the rest of the world is going for me? 

Why should I worry about being sick, when that sickness won't kill me like it would've many years ago?

What's the purpose of trying to get something to be happier, when I'd be sacrificing much more happiness to get said thing?

I always thought my parents raised me to be grateful, but that's not close to the truth. I have always wanted more, and more, and more out of myself, others and whoever will listen.

That selfishness has gotten me pretty far, but not nearly far enough in the general life outlook column.

#### There is issues with too much gratefulness, as there is with everything else though.

If you are okay with what you have, you become complacent. I have much different goals in life than complacency. Maybe that drive for more and more isn't a bad thing, but a motivator.

There's nothing more I want than success in my life. I don't know what success will look like to me completely (it changes every day), but I know I won't be achieving it if I sit around and stay content.

From what I've seen in others, there's much more to life than happiness. There's milestones I've yet to hit and successes I've yet to have. I have a whole life ahead of me, so sitting around and basking in the greatness of one feeling won't be as great as it currently is for much longer.

From all I've read, emotions are like a drug addiction in some way. You try it once, and it feels great. But the feeling will keep diminishing. So it's better to lay out your successes, so that your end game is big and you feel the greatest sense of accomplishment you'll ever feel then. Everything after that becomes a afterthough. 

At least that's what I think.

#### But in the end,

the feeling of being grateful for everything you have can save you. 

If you're feeling down, think about what you *do* have rather than what you don't.

If you feel your life spiraling out of control, think about what you do have a strong grasp and devote more time to that until everything normalizes.

If you think you don't have enough at your current age, go out and feed the homeless and let that put into perspective what you really do have.

Gratefulness is great in small doses, so make sure to get your dose as often as is feasible.
