# Intolerance and Incivility

I've had a lot of time today. I've had nearly 4 hours after my shift ended at my favorite place in the world to do whatever it is I do, and I've just been thinking.

One of the things that interested me today was the concept of intolerance and incivliity. I think these two concepts are what make me a true moderate.

There's absolutely nothing I despise more than either of these traits in a person (well, besides extreme cynicism). Both of these tend to go hand in hand, but get used much differently.

Let me start off by defining both, and then I'll dive into each. 

Intolerance ([as defined by Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/intolerance)) is unwillingness or refusal to tolerate or respect opinions or beliefs contrary to one's own. 

Incivility ([as defined by Merriam-Webster](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/incivility)) is rude or unsociable speech or behavior.

I'll start with...

## Intolerance

Intolerance is one of the worst human traits to have. It has no political leaning, it has no gender preference, it has no race preference, and it has no religious preference (though certain religions may push for it moreso than others)

The most common use you'll see in today's society would be in the mouths of leftists claiming racism, sexism, and Islamophobia. They tend to say conservatives who do not want to accept immigrants into their country are intolerant. In their mind, the conservatives are scared of the skin of the person, rather than the content of their character or many other factors.

I've found most conservatives aren't scared of the people as a whole because they're brown skinned terrorists, but rather because their ideology promotes anti-western ideals. This is specifically what I believe. This comes to be misconstrued as "the right is scared of ideas different from their own", or otherwise known as intolerance.

However, in contrast, this isn't intolerance. While it certainly might be in some cases, conservatives generally don't hate the players, they hate the game (which is one of destroying the very culture that brought up some of the most successful countries in the world). That, I find, is very defensible. 

Conservatives ARE intolerant in their own ways, however. I've found there's a certain culture of deeming anything supported by the left "stupid" or "illogical", simply because it's supported by leftists. They have a general ideology of doing things to spite the other side while also bringing themselves down. This is what I might call a "political suicide bombing."

It can be somewhat seen in the election of Donald Trump. I've found a lot of the conservatives I've met who voted for Trump might not have agreed with what he was saying, but wanted nothing more than to see the numerous videos on the internet of leftists crying after seeing Hillary lost. That in itself is one of the most appalling things I've seen. They were willing to vote for a man whose ideals directly contradicts their own just to see their "enimies" burn. 

But in that same vein, you can see some absolutely abhorrent unchecked intolerance by the left wing in the election of Donald Trump. There were numerous articles and left-wing figureheads calling those who voted for Trump "racist", "sexist", and "islamophobic", when that couldn't be further from the truth.

While I did say I've found a lot of conservatives that voted for Trump to spite the left, but they DID have reasons to support the man. They just chose the least defensible reason as their leading argument.

And I have this feeling some of this leftist double think will lead to even more "LIBS CRYING AFTER BERNIE LOSES" montages on the internet. If you call a man "racist" when he knows he is not, that won't change his mind unless he has unbearably low self esteem. If you call a man "sexist" when he knows he is not, that won't change his mind unless he has unbearably low self esteem. If you call a man "islamophobic" when he knows he is not, that won't change his mind unless he has unbearably low self esteem.

In fact, it will do quite the opposite. You've seen conservatives somewhat articulate this when they say "this is why Trump won" after seeing some crazy left wing talker saying something like "if you voted for Trump, off yourself." But once you make those accusations of a man, you cannot take them back. And when you accuse a man of something he hasn't done, he is much less likely to support you in the future. Nobody is going to vote for someone who calls them something in which they are not, so for the left to better support their position of Donald Trump losing they should focus on what he's doing wrong without calling it one of the numerous "-ist" words.

And this reasoning justifies the right wingers intolerance to themselves in a very circular way (much like how the left wing's ideas are very circular on their own).

The intolerance in American politics nowadays is rampant, and tends to lead to much of what I'm talking about next. 

Which is...

## Incivility

I've found I hate no one trait more than incivility. The blatant disrespect of ideas is detestable. It does, in juxtaposition to intolerance, have a political leaning. And this is due much to the nature of conservatives and leftists.

Conservatives tend to conform much more when compared to moderates, and moderates tend to conform much more when compared to leftists ([Link to study on springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03335275)). This means conservatives won't go out of their way to insult someone who disagrees with them much like a leftist will. From what I've seen, conservatives tend to respect someone who can hold their head in a debate (i.e. Jordan Peterson in the Cathy Newman debate), and liberals like to see no punches pulled.

Conservatives, in general, want to see a fair debate ground, while leftists don't care if the grounds are fair and will take any advantage they can (crowd, ad-hominem, unwillingness to debate certain subjects.) That's not to say there aren't liberals out there that want to see a fair debate and there aren't conservatives who like seeing people take digs at others, it just tends to happen more in the way I originally stated.

Some might argue, however, that because leftists are much higher in the trait "agreeableness" by default, they'd be more likely to want a fair debate. I can see where that might be coming from, but American politics has devolved to a point where the right wingers are the enimies to the leftists, and they are outside their tribe. (Side note: tribalism is talked about a lot by Jordan Peterson and Amy Chua, who are both great speakers. Definitely watch some of their material.) I've seen this described as a mother bear protecting those who are their own (i.e. those that agree with them). So, from that, you can argue that people tend to be less agreeable with those who are seen as enemies (or a bear attacking a human if it feels like it's family is being encroached). 

This is also very widely seen in protests. You'll see more leftist on conservative hate than you will vice versa. This is because conservatives know they're not doing this for the crowd at hand, but rather the folks back home who might see this and think "well, if they do that to him when he's being respectful, then what would they do to me?" 

Incivility is also very widely seen in the outright slandering of Trump supporters. You'll see claims of fascism and (as previously mentioned) many "-ist" words, while not so much from the other side. 

If you believed half of what the media says about Trump supporters, you'd probably think they're going around killing people who don't agree with them and trying to remove the civil rights of different racial minorities. 

But yet again, that's just because of the divisiveness of American politics today.

As a final note on Incivility, I'd like to say much of what drove me to adore Jordan Peterson was his absolute civility in the face of intolerance. In the Cathy Newman interview, she outright misconstrued literally everything the man said. She'd begin every sentence with "So, what you're saying is..." and end it with accusations of racism. Despite that, the man didn't flinch. He didn't fall into ad-hominem attacks. He didn't play her game. And that made me listen to nearly everything the man has ever said. 

The same can't be said about other right wing figureheads like Ben Shapiro, who believes much more in the "if they insult me, I'm coming back" mentality. While I do have periods of wanting to watch the "LIBS DESTROYED!!!!" compilations, I don't respect much of what the man says because he WILL resort tot he childish tactics that might be used against him. 

## Final notes

Incivility and Intolerance aren't acceptable in society nowadays. People need to learn to grow up and move on from the childish tactics used on both sides. Not much else to be said there.

But if you told me a year ago that I'd write a whole essay and ENJOY IT, I'd laugh in your face. The truth is, when not being forced to write something, I enjoy it much more. Very interesting to say the least.

Anyways, that's all I have for this post. 

With tolerance and civility,

Tyler Carr
